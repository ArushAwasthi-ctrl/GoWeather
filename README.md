I am super excited to show you GoWeather, a sleek and intuitive weather application that I made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🎯

🌟 Features:

🔍 Weather search by city in real time.

🌡️ Displays the temperature, condition, and various icons depicting the weather.

🌎 “World” tab for a quick glance at the weather of major global cities.

⚠️ Invalid searches are handled gracefully.

📱 Mobile responsive UI that is simple yet clean.

🛠️ How I Built It: 

Used the Open Weather Map API to fetch live weather data.

Designed the UI with rubik font with a centered smartphone like layout.

Implemented navigation and error messages using js DOM manipulation.

Adhered to modular programming principles. Made separate modules for main, search, and world pages.

🧠 Challenges Faced: 

Understanding asynchronous javascript (API Calls, promises).

Designing a responsive and clean aligned UI.

Handling multiple pages (index, search, world) with consistent design and navigation.

Edge cases like a city-not-found and empty input boxes.

🎯 What I Learned: 

Hands on experience with frontend development.

Practical application of REST APIs.

Improved understanding of responsive design with modular javascript.

Building GoWeather taught me a lot about API integration and design principles which will certainly help in my future projects.
